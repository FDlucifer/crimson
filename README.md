#### It consists of three partially interdependent modules:
* crimson_recon   - automates the process of domain reconnaissance.
* crimson_target  - automates the process of urls reconnaissance.
* crimson_exploit - automates the process of bug founding.


#### :small_red_triangle_down:crimson_recon
> This module can help you if you have to test big infrastructure or you are trying to earn some bounties in *.scope.com domain. It includes many web scraping and bruteforcing tools.

#### :small_red_triangle_down:crimson_target
> This module covers one particular domain chosen by you for testing. It uses a lot of vulnerability scanners, web scrapers and bruteforcing tools.

#### :small_red_triangle_down:crimson_exploit
> This module uses a number of tools to automate the search for certain bugs in a list of urls.

# Usage
##### :diamonds: First module needs `domain name` to work properly, f.e. `google.com` :diamonds:

```bash
./crimson_recon "domain.com"

```
* If you are interested in how this module works, I encourage you to study the source code. I tried to describe in the comments how the individual tools works. 
* Additionally, you can learn more about `crimson_recon` module by reading my article at [medium](https://karol-mazurek95.medium.com/automation-of-the-reconnaissance-phase-during-web-application-penetration-testing-i-574fd9dce53e)
 
##### :diamonds: Second module needs `subdomain name`. You can additionally put `authorization cookie` :diamonds:
```bash
./crimson_target -d "example.domain.com" -c "Cookie: auth1=123;"
```
